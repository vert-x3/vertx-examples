= Vert.x Opentracing example

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Opentracing in action.

Please consult the Vert.x Opentracing for the detailed documentation.

== Microservices

This example shows a couple of simple microservices monitored with Vert.x Opentracing

=== Joke service

The Joke service provides an HTTP microservice for jokes stored in a PostgreSQL.

The HTTP server and the database client contribute traces.

You can query this service with curl:

[source]
----
> curl http://localhost:8082
----

=== Hello service

The Hello service provides an HTTP microservice for saying hello. This service uses the Joke
service to tell the user a joke.

The HTTP server and the HTTP client contribute traces.

You can query this service with curl:

[source]
----
> curl http://localhost:8081
----

=== Gateway

The Gateway is a simple HTTP gateway that exposes both Joke and Hello services.

The HTTP server and the HTTP client contribute traces.

You can query this service with curl:

[source]
----
> curl http://localhost:8080/hello
> curl http://localhost:8080/joke
----

== Opentracing

You need to start an https://opentracing.io[Opentracing] server, such as Jaeger

[source]
----
> docker run -d -p5775:5775/udp -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p5778:5778 -p16686:16686 -p14268:14268 -p9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:0.8.0
----

Jaeger provides a visual http://localhost:16686/[console]

You can run the _Hello_, _Joke_ and _Gateway_ services in your IDE with link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/opentracing/OpentracingExample.java[Opentracing Example]

Or you can start them separately:

- link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/opentracing/Gateway.java[Gateway]
- link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/opentracing/HelloService.java[Hello service]
- link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/opentracing/JokeService.java[Joke service]
