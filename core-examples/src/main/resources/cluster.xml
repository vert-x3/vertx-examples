        While recovering from split-brain (network partitioning),

        cluster, there might an existing entry with the same key already.
        Values of these entries might be different for that same key.
        Which value should be set for the key? Conflict is resolved by
        the policy set here. Default policy is PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy

        There are built-in merge policies such as
        com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy; entry will be added if there is no existing entry for the key.
        com.hazelcast.map.merge.PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy ; entry will be added if the merging entry doesn't exist in the cluster.
        com.hazelcast.map.merge.HigherHitsMapMergePolicy ; entry with the higher hits wins.
        com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy ; entry with the latest update wins.
