* camel bridge configuration (outbound)
* SEDA support
* filter and transformations

**Source code:**

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/camel/feed/FeedExample[Feed Example]

Launch it by running the `main` method in your IDE or, after having build the project with `mvn clean package`, with:


----
java -jar target/camel-bridge-examples-3.5.2.jar run io.vertx.example.camel.feed.FeedExample
----

== RMI example

This example demonstrates:

* routes that are use as _RPC_ support
* camel bridge configuration (inbound)

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/camel/rmi/RMIExample[RMI Example]

Launch it by running the `main` method in your IDE , after having build the project with `mvn clean package`, with:

----
java -jar target/camel-bridge-examples-3.5.2.jar run io.vertx.example.camel.rmi.RMIExample
