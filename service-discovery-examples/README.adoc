= Vert.x Service Discovery examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Service Discovery

Vert.x service discovery provides an infrastructure to publish and discover various resources, such as service proxies, HTTP endpoints, data sources and etc.

A service provider can:

* publish a service record

* un-publish a published record (withdraw a record)

* update the status of a published service (down, out of service…​)

A service consumer can:

* lookup for services

* bind to a selected service (it gets a ServiceReference) and use it

* release the service once the consumer is done with it

* listen for arrival, departure and modification of services.

Providers and consumers must create their own ServiceDiscovery instance. These instances are collaborating in background to keep the set of services in sync.

== ServiceDiscoveryVerticle example

* Creates and publish a few services

* Unpublish a service

* Consumes a published service and release it.

You can run the ServiceDiscoveryVerticle.java class from your IDE or call:

  vertx run src/main/java/io/vertx/example/service/discovery/ServiceDiscoveryVerticle.java
