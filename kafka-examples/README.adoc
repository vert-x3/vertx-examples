= Vert.x Kafka Client examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating the usage of the Vert.x Kafka Client.

== Monitoring dashboard

The monitoring dashboard examples shows the usage of both the producer and consumer APIs of the Kafka client.

The link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/kafka/dashboard/MetricsVerticle.java[MetricsVerticle.java] uses the
Kafka producer API to produce metrics in Json format.

The link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/kafka/dashboard/DashboardVerticle.java[DashboardVerticle.java] uses the
Kafka producer API to consume the metrics and send them to a monitoring dashboard using the Event Bus.

The link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/kafka/dashboard/MainVerticle.java[MainVerticle.java] is the main program
you should start as it starts a Kafka broker and then configures the DashboardVerticle and the MetricsVerticle
with their consumer and producer config.

Run the `MainVerticle` main method and then open your browser at http://localhost:8080/

In real usage the Kafka broker would probably be managed externally and the `DashboardVerticle` /
`MetricsVerticle` executed separately with their own configuration.
