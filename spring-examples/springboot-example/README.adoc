= Vert.x Spring Boot example

This example shows how you can embed Vert.x in Spring Boot.

So now you can add all the goodness of Vert.x to your Spring Boot applications

It's basically the same example as the Vert.x-Web "staticsite" example in this repository but instead of using
Vert.x to boot it it uses Spring Boot to start it.

The end result is more or less the same as using Vert.x without Spring Boot:

* There is a similar amount of code and boilerplate (both very little)
* Both Vert.x and Spring Boot create executable fat jars (The Vert.x jar is considerable smaller than the Spring Boot one though)
* The Spring Boot version seems a bit slower to startup than the Vert.x version

To build the "fat jar"

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/springboot-example-2.2.2.RELEASE.jar

To run using spring boot maven plugin

    mvn spring-boot:run

To access application in the browser

    http://localhost:8080/
