= Spring Boot Hazelcast Clustering

This project shows how you can setup a clustered Vert.x embedded in Spring Boot, having the Spring container managing Hazelcast.

It consists of two verticles.
The first one starts an HTTP server, expecting a `name` query parameter, and sending it on the event bus.
The second one listens to names sent on the event bus, and replies with a formatted message.
Eventually the message goes to the client in the HTTP response body.

== The code

In the `io.vertx.examples.spring.clustering.hazelcast.VertxProducer` class, a clustered Vert.x instance is created.
It uses a Spring-managed `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance`.

There are multiple ways to configure it, but a simple one is to put a `hazelcast.xml` file at the root of the classpath.

The Hazelcast instance will be created *before* and destroyed *after* Vert.x.

IMPORTANT: the Hazelcast shutdown hook must be disabled.

To disable it, simply add this to the `hazelcast.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
    <!-- ... other properties ... -->
    <property name="hazelcast.shutdownhook.enabled">false</property>
  </properties>
----

== Trying

To see clustering in action, you should start multiple instances of this application.
The HTTP server will be setup only if you provide an `httpPort` system property.

So you can start the first instance with an HTTP server on port 8081:

[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -DhttpPort=8081
----

And then start the other instances without the HTTP server:

[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

It's time for testing now:

[source,shell]
----
seq 10 | while read i; do curl http://localhost:8081/?name=Thomas${i}; echo; done
----
