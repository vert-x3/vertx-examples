= Vert.x examples

This repository contains a range of examples so you can get up and running easily with Vert.x.

== Maven users

Start with the link:maven-simplest[simplest Maven example] to show you how to setup a simple Vert.x project that uses
Maven. You need to have Java 8 installed and set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java 8
installation.

Use that as a template for setting up a Maven project with Vert.x.

Progress to the link:maven-verticles/maven-verticle[simple Maven verticle example] to show you how to deploy your code as verticles in a Maven project. Also check link:maven-verticles[Maven verticles examples] to show how you can use Maven with Groovy, Ruby, and JavaScript verticles.

Want to start right away, open the first example in Eclipse Che:

== Gradle users

Start with the link:gradle-simplest[simplest Gradle example] to show you how to setup a simple Vert.x project that uses Gradle.

Use that as a template for setting up a Gradle project with Vert.x.

Progress to the link:gradle-verticles[simple Gradle verticle example] to show you how to deploy your code as verticles in
a Gradle project

== Neither Maven nor Gradle users

That's fine too :)

You can run most of the examples at the command line using `vertx run` if you have Vert.x installed (see below).


== Some examples need examples-utils

You may find examples that need examples-utils. You need to build it from link:examples-utils:

```
git clone https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples.git
cd vertx-examples
cd examples-utils
mvn clean install
```

== The examples

The examples demonstrate how to use all different bits of Vert.x including Vert.x core, Vert.x-Web and various other
services and features.

Most of the examples have been written as verticles. For more information on verticles please consult the Vert.x core manual.

Using verticles allows you to scale and run your code from the command line more easily, but if you prefer the same code in the verticles can also be run embedded. It's really up to you. Verticles are
entirely optional in Vert.x.

== Different languages

Most of the examples are available in all the languages that Vert.x supports.

You'll find the examples for the relevant language in a directory `src/main/${lang}` where `lang` is an identifier for the
 language, e.g. `java`, `js`, `ruby` etc.

For example you'll find the Vert.x core Java examples in link:core-examples/src/main/java[] and you'll find the Vert.x core
JavaScript examples in link:core-examples/src/main/js[]

NOTE: All the non-Java examples are automatically generated from the Java examples using our magic code translator.

=== Running the examples

==== Running in your IDE

Most of the Java examples can be run directly in your IDE (if you have one!).

We provide a `main()` method in most of the example classes which allows you to conveniently run them directly in your IDE.

Just right click the main method or class in your IDE and run as... application (supported by all major IDEs).

==== Running at the command line

If `vertx` is installed you can also run any verticle directly on the command line. This way of working may be of interest
to you, if you don't want to use Maven or Gradle or perhaps you don't use an IDE.

Or perhaps you're just a command line kind of person.

If you're coming from using other platforms such as Node.js you might want to work this way. You can think of the
`vertx` command as a bit like the `node` command in Node.js.

Instructions for installing Vert.x are in the next section.

Once Vert.x is installed, to run an example, just cd to the example directory and type `vertx run` followed by the filename
of the verticle. For example

----
cd core-examples/src/main/java/io/vertx/example/core
vertx run EchoServer.java

cd core-examples/src/main/js/echo
vertx run echo_server.js
----

Yes! You can run *Java source files* directly using Vert.x (no compilation required).

==== Installing Vert.x

NOTE: This is only necessary if you want to run Vert.x at the command line. If you'd prefer to work with Maven or
Gradle projects then you don't need to pre-install Vert.x - you just let Maven/Gradle pull in the Vert.x dependencies
into your project as you would with any dependency.

Pre-requisites: You will need to have Java 8 JDK installed.

1. Download a link:https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/view[Vert.x 3 distribution]
2. Unzip it somewhere on your disk (e.g. in your home directory)
3. Set your `PATH` environment variable to include the installation directory
4. Test the install by typing `vertx -version`.

On the download page, you will find several _distributions_. Each distribution has a different set
 of components:

* **Min**: The _min_ distribution contains only Vert.x Core, the support of the different
 languages, and the Hazelcast clustering.
* **Full**: The _full_ distribution contains all the components of the Vert.x stack. It includes
 Vert.x web and the different data access technologies.
