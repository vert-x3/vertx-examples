= Vert.x 4 examples

This repository contains a range of examples, so you can get up and running easily with Vert.x. 4

Vert.x 3 examples can be found here https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/3.x

== The examples

The examples demonstrate how to use all different bits of Vert.x including Vert.x core, Vert.x-Web and various other services and features.

Most of the examples have been written as verticles. For more information on verticles please consult the Vert.x core manual.

Using verticles allows you to scale and run your code from the command line more easily, but if you prefer the same code in the verticles can also be run embedded.
It's really up to you.
Verticles are entirely optional in Vert.x.

=== Running the examples

==== Running in your IDE

Most of the Java examples can be run directly in your IDE.

We provide a `main()` method in most of the example classes which allows you to conveniently run them directly in your IDE.

Just right-click the main method or class in your IDE and run as... application (supported by all major IDEs).

=== Vert.x core examples

Vertx-Unit is a library for writing asynchronous tests. We include some examples of how to use this tool to test
your Vert.x (or other asynchronous) applications.

The link:unit-examples/README.adoc[Vert.x Unit examples] shows how to use Vert.x Unit.

=== Virtual Threads

The `virtual-threads-examples` module shows how to use Vert.x with virtual threads.

See link:virtual-threads-examples/README.adoc[Vert.x Virtual Threads 5 examples].

=== Kotlin examples

The link:kotlin-examples/README.adoc[Vert.x Kotlin Examples] shows a few examples with Kotlin such a REST application,
Kotlin coroutines and usage of https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest[KotlinTest].

=== Mail examples

The link:mail-examples/README.adoc[Vert.x Mail examples]
contains a few examples using Vert.x Mail

The mail examples show different ways to create the mail message and send it via
tls, ssl etc. The examples either use `localhost:25` to send a mail or use host
`mail.example.com`. To actually run the examples you will have to change the
mail server and the user credentials in the `MailLogin` example.

=== Service Proxy Examples

The link:service-proxy-examples/README.adoc[Vert.x Service Proxy examples] contains an example of service proxy usage.
It depicts how a service provider can be implemented and how the published service can be consumed.
