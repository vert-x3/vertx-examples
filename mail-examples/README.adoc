= Vert.x Mail examples

Here you'll find some examples how to use Vert.x mail-service to send mails
to a SMTP server either from the local machine or via the event bus on another
machine.


By default these example starts a "fake" mails server (just logging on the console):

[source]
----
LocalSmtpServer.start(2526);
----

If you want to use a different SMTP server, just remove this line and configure the options.

The examples use a few different configs

== link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mail/MailLocalhost.java[MailLocalhost]

Just send a mail without authentication.

== link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mail/MailLogin.java[MailLogin]

Send a mail to an external smtp server (e.g. googlemail, sendgrid, aol etc)
requiring a login.

The login will currently use DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, PLAIN and LOGIN in order of
preference. If the server announces AUTH but you don't need it (e.g. if you are
authenticated by a local ip address) turn login off with `LoginOption.DISABLE`.
To specifically select an AUTH method or define the order of preference, you
can do `setAuthMethods("METHOD1 METHOD2")`.

== link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mail/MailServiceExample.java[MailServiceExample]

Send a mail via the event bus to another vert.x instance registered as
`vertx.mail`. This will use the config set by the service and doesn't use a local
config object.

This example shows how to leave out the From address in a mail but setting
the bounceAddress property instead.

the example deploys the mail service, however you can refactor the example to
skip this step and start the service as follows:

----
vertx run service:io.vertx.mail-service
----

and vertx will pick up the package from maven and start it with default config.

== link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mail/MailHeaders.java[MailHeaders]

Send a mail with supplied headers (e.g. Received, Message-ID, Reply-To)

This example shows how you can send headers in a mail.

== link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mail/MailImages.java[MailImages]

This example shows how to send inlined images in mails.
