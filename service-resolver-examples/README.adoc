= Vert.x Service Resolver examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Service Resolver

The Vert.x service resolver is a plugin that lets Vert.x clients call services using logical service names instead of network addresses. The service resolver is also able to perform client side load balancing.

== Consul DNS example

This example demonstrates how to configure the Vert.x HTTP client to resolve service address against a Consul
server using DNS.

== Custom mapping

This example demonstrates how to configure the Vert.x HTTP client to resolve service address using a custom mapping, i.e.
a function that returns a list of socket addresses given a service name.
