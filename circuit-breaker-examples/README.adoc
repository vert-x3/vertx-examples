= Vert.x Circuit Breaker examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Circuit Breaker.

Vert.x Circuit Breaker is an implementation of the Circuit Breaker _pattern_ for Vert.x.

It keeps track of the
number of failures and _open the circuit_ when a threshold is reached. Optionally, a fallback is executed.

Supported failures are:

* failures reported by your code
* exception thrown by your code
* uncompleted futures (timeout)

Operations guarded by a circuit breaker are intended to by non-blocking and asynchronous in order to benefits from
the Vert.x execution model.

To use the circuit breaker you need to:

* Create a circuit breaker, with the configuration you want (timeout, number of failure before opening the circuit)

* Execute some code using the breaker

== Client example


** Creates a circuit breaker which
  * can fail 5 times before opening the circuit
  * consider a failure if the operation does not succeed in time
  * time spent in open state before attempting to re-try is 5 seconds
  * call the fallback method on failures

** The execute method sends a request to localhost at port 8080

** The fallback is called whenever the circuit is open

To run this example you need to:

1. start or not the server (if not started, the circuit breaker will invoke the fallback)
2. start the client


To start the server, run the `Server.java` class from your IDE or call:

----
vertx run src/main/java/io/vertx/example/circuit/breaker/Server.java
----

To start the client, run the `Client.java` class from your IDE or call:

----
# java version
vertx run src/main/java/io/vertx/example/circuit/breaker/Client.java

# groovy version
vertx run src/main/groovy/io/vertx/example/circuit/breaker/client.groovy

# javascript version
vertx run src/main/js/io/vertx/example/circuit/breaker/client.js
