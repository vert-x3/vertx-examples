= Vert.x Simple Gradle Verticle project for JavaScript

This project is very similar to the gradle-verticle project but instead of having a verticle implemented in Java, it
uses a JavaScript verticle.

The build.gradle uses the Gradle shadowJar plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build the "fat jar"

    ./gradlew shadowJar

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar build/libs/gradle-verticle-js-3.5.2-fat.jar

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).
