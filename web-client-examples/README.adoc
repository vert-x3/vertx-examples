= Vert.x Web-Client examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Web Client in action.

Vert.x Web Client is an asynchronous HTTP and HTTP/2 client. Please consult the Vert.x Web Client manual for detailed
documentation on Vert.x Web Client.

== Logging

When running in an IDE you can edit `src/main/resources/vertx-default-jul-logging.properties` to configure logging.
Trace logging is enabled for Vert.x Web Client classes so you can easily trace requests as they are routed through different
handlers.

== Dependencies required

To use Vert.x Web Client in your own Maven or Gradle project you will need following dependencies

----
Group ID: io.vertx
Artifact ID: vertx-core
----

and

----
Group ID: io.vertx
Artifact ID: vertx-web-client
----

If you're using a template engine you will also need to add the engine dependency explicitly, depending on the engine
you are using.

== Simple

This example uses the web client to send a request and log the response.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/simple/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/simple/Client.java[Java simple HTTP client]

== Query params

This example uses the web client to send a request with query params using the fluent API and log the response.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/queryparams/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/queryparams/Client.java[Java query params HTTP client]

The server logs the query string on the console.

The client add several query parameters to the http request with the fluent API, the client takes care of
encoding the parameters.

== HTTPS

This example is like the simple example but shows how to configure the client for sending SSL/TLS requests.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/https/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/https/Client.java[Java SSL/TLS HTTP client]

== Sending bodies

The web client is able to send various kinds of bodies to the server.

=== Hello World

This examples shows how to send a body with "Hello World" with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/helloworld/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/helloworld/Client.java[Java client sending a form]

=== Sending a form

This examples shows how to send a form with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/formurlencoded/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/formurlencoded/Client.java[Java client sending a form]

=== Sending a json object

This examples shows how to send a json object with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/jsonobject/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/jsonobject/Client.java[Java client sending a json object]

=== Sending a POJO mapped to json

This examples shows how to send a simple java object encoded as a json object with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/jsonpojo/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/jsonpojo/Client.java[Java client sending a POJO encoded as a json object]

=== Sending a multipart form

This examples shows how to send a multipart form with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/multipartform/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/multipartform/Client.java[Java client sending a multipart form]

=== Sending a stream

This examples shows how to send a vertx read stream with the web client.

The web client takes care of setting up the pump between the read stream and the http client request.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/stream/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/send/stream/Client.java[Java client sending an async file]

== Receiving response bodies

The web client can unmarshall response bodies to various formats.

=== Receiving a json object body

This examples shows how to decode a json object body with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/response/jsonobject/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/response/jsonobject/Client.java[Java client expecting a json object body]

=== Receiving a POJO mapped to json

This examples shows how to decode a json object body to a simple java object with the web client.

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/response/jsonpojo/Server.java[Java HTTP server]
link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/webclient/response/jsonpojo/Client.java[Java client expecting a json object body as a POJO]
