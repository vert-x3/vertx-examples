= Vert.x Maven examples


This project shows how you can use Apache Maven to package your verticles. Each project is very similar to the
maven-simplest project but instead of embedding Vert.x it shows an example of writing the code as a verticle.

It covers:

* Java: link:maven-verticle[]
* JavaScript: link:maven-verticle-js[]
* Groovy: link:maven-verticle-groovy[]
* Groovy compiled: link:maven-verticle-groovy-compiled[] (The Groovy files are compiled)
* Ruby: link:maven-verticle-rb[]

You can build all projects using:

```
mvn clean package
```
