= Vert.x Simple Maven Verticle for Compiled Groovy project

This project is very similar to the maven-verticle-groovy project but it compiles the Goovy verticle.

The pom.xml compiles the groovy classes form `src/main/groovy` and package the verticle.

The pom.xml uses the Maven shade plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build a "fat jar"

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/maven-verticle-compiled-groovy-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).
