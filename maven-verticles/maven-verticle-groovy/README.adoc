= Vert.x Simple Maven Verticle for Groovy project

This project is very similar to the maven-verticle project but instead of using a Java verticle is uses a Groovy
verticle.

You can run it directly in your IDE by creating a run configuration that uses the main class `io.vertx.core.Launcher`
and passes in the arguments `run src/main/groovy/MyGroovyVerticle`.

The pom.xml uses the Maven shade plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build a "fat jar"

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/maven-verticle-groovy-3.1.0-fat.jar

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).
