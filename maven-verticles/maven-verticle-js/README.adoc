= Vert.x Simple Maven Verticle for JavaScript project

This project is very similar to the maven-verticle project but instead of using a Java verticle is uses a JavaScript
verticle.

You can run it directly in your IDE by creating a run configuration that uses the main class `io.vertx.core.Launcher`
and passes in the arguments `run src/main/js/MyJavaScriptVerticle`.

The pom.xml uses the Maven shade plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build a "fat jar"

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/maven-verticle-javascript-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).

Now point your browser at http://localhost:8080

You can also launch the application from Maven directly:

* to run it using the classes form target/classes: `mvn compile exec:java@run`
* to run the fat jar: `mvn package exec:exec@run-app`
