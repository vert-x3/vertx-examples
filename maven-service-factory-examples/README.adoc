= Vert.x Maven Service Factory Example

This project demonstrates how to use the Vert.x Maven service factory. The Vertx Maven service factory lets you deploy
 and runs verticles packaged in Maven artifacts.

== Packaging the verticle

The link:maven-service-factory-verticle[Maven service factory verticle project] is an example of verticle that you
can deploy using the Maven service factory. The project contains a very simple verticle but also a
link:maven-service-factory-verticle/src/main/resources/my-verticle.json[description] specifying the main verticle class.

To build this verticle just launch `mvn clean install` from the maven-service-factory-verticle project. _Install_ is
important as it needs to be stored in the Maven local repository.

== Running the verticle

You can run the verticle from anywhere using:

[source]
----
vertx run maven:io.vertx:maven-service-factory-verticle:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT::my-verticle
----

The identifier is constructed as follows:
`maven` + `:` + the _groupId_ + `:` + the _artifactId_ + `:` + the version + `::` + the name of the verticle

NOTE: The name of the verticle is the name of the json (descriptor) file.

== Deploying the verticle using the API

You can also deploy the verticle using the `vertx.deployVerticle` method. An example is given in the
link:maven-service-factory-api[Maven service factory api project]. In
link:maven-service-factory-api/src/main/java/io/vertx/examples/MyDeployingVerticle[this verticle], the previous
verticle is deployed using:

----
vertx.deployVerticle("maven:io.vertx:maven-service-factory-verticle:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT::my-verticle", r -> { ... });
----

To run this project just launch:

----
cd maven-service-factory-api
mvn clean package
vertx run io.vertx.examples.MyDeployingVerticle -cp target/maven-service-factory-api-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
