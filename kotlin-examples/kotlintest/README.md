# Kotlin Test (kotlintest)

A Vert.x example project that shows how to test Vert.x code using the **Kotlin Test** framework (software testing). This project uses Gradle so in order to run the tests execute one of the following commands in a terminal:
```
    # Run this line if using a Unix based OS (eg Linux).
    ./gradlew test
    
    # Run this line if using Windows.
    gradlew.bat test
```

For more information on how to test Vert.x code using Kotlin Test please refer to the [testing guide](testing-guide.md).
