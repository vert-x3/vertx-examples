= Vert.x Web GraphQL examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Web GraphQL in action.

https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-graphql/java/[Vert.x Web GraphQL] extends Vert.x Web with the https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL-Java] library so that you can build a GraphQL server.

== Simple GraphQL server and client

This example uses the Vert.x Web client to send a request to the GraphQL server and log the response.

The backend is a very basic Hackernews clone: it holds a list of web pages, as well as info about the user who posted each link.
The link:src/main/resources/links.graphqls[GraphQL schema] describes the data with:

* `Link` and `User` types
* the `allLinks` query

First you need to run the server then you can run the client.
