= Vert.x 3.1 Simplest Gradle project

This project shows a very simple hello world Vert.x 3.1 project using Gradle, which has a simple HTTP server which
simply returns "Hello World!" to every request.

In this example Vert.x is used embedded. I.e. we use the Vert.x APIs directly in our own classes rather than deploying
the code in verticles.

You can run or debug the example in your IDE by just right clicking the main class and run as.. or debug as...

The build.gradle uses the Gradle shadowJar plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build the "fat jar"

    ./gradlew shadowJar

Because the application plugin is being used, you may directly run the application:

    ./gradlew run

You may also run the fat jar as a standalone runnable jar:

    java -jar build/libs/gradle-simplest-3.3.3-fat.jar

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).
